**Generalized Poisson Distribution for NumPyro Integration**  

## Overview  
This script implements the generalized Poisson distribution, designed for use with NumPyro integration. As an extension of the Poisson distribution, it accommodates both underdispersion and overdispersion. For more information about the distribution, please refer to the following sources:
